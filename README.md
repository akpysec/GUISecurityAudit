# Security Audit .txt files GUI

Created to perform Security Auditing with output .txt files.
Once you have output file with specific parameters you can update "Dictionaries" within the script & add the associated keys to the Tree view portion.

This is my first project don't judge to hard ;)
I've got a lot of help from my coworker Milan Charniak (https://github.com/charnim), he helped me a lot with this script and improoving my skills.
